# Hack Wall
## Created in 24 Hours for Facebook 2013 Global Hackathon

HackWall is a real-time collaborative wall where users can develop ideas through notes and annotations. All a user has to do is create a wall and send the link to a friend. Communications are broadcasted through Socket.IO, and walls are persisted to MongoDB.
